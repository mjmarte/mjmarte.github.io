## Research Interests

I came to the Aphasia Research Laboratory to instrumentalize my clinical knowledge and interrogate topics at the intersection of language and brain injury. Specifically, I am interested in characterizing the ways in which life experiences (e.g., bilingualism) modulate language representation in individuals, and furthermore, how those changes manifest in the presence of aphasia.
