Broadly, I am interested in characterizing the ways in which life experiences (e.g., bilingualism) modulate language representation in individuals, and furthermore, how those changes manifest in the presence of aphasia. Below are descriptions of results of projects I am currently or have previously worked on.

## The cognate effect in bilingual aphasia (Marte et al., in preparation)
In this study, we sought to compare the factors influencing naming accuracy in L1 and L2 on English-Spanish cognates and noncognates in healthy bilinguals and bilingual persons with aphasia.

Using logistic mixed-effects regression modeling, results suggested that (i) mathematical treatments (e.g., principal component analysis) of language experience data is an informative predictor of naming in both healthy and clinical bilingual populations, and (ii) cognateness yields only minor benefits for bilingual persons with aphasia, exhibiting minimal predictive power on naming accuracy, relative to healthy bilinguals.

## Dynamic causal modeling of semantic decisions in bilingual aphasia (Marte et al., under review)
In this study, we used a case-series approach to compare the neural correlates of semantic connectivity in four bilingual persons with aphasia (BWA) and four bilingual healthy controls (BHC) performing a semantic judgment task. 

Using dynamic causal modeling (DCM), we constructed several neurobiologically plausible models of semantic processing to test hypotheses regarding the laterality and directionality of effective connectivity in these individuals. The results of DCM analyses revealed distinct patterns of semantic network connectivity in BHC and BWA. Results from case-control comparisons on behavioral and effective connectivity measures converged to indicate significant differences between the cohorts as a factor of language dominance, i.e., the less- or non-dominant language resulted in poorer performance on behavioral measures and relatively greater excitatory instantiation of activity at right inferior gyrus pars triangularis in BWA. We conclude with discussion of each individual patientâ€™s resulting model in both languages and use information from their clinical and language experience profiles to characterize four descriptions of bilingual aphasia.
