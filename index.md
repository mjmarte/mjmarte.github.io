I am a Ph.D. candidate in Speech, Language and Hearing Sciences at Boston University (BU). Here, I work with the support and mentorship of Dr. [Swathi Kiran](https://www.bu.edu/sargent/profile/swathi-kiran-ph-d-ccc-slp/) in the [Center for Brain Recovery](https://www.bu.edu/cbr/). My primary research interest is in bi/multilingual aphasia, accompanied by interests in machine learning, semantic processing, and disparities in communication disorders.

Prior to BU, I was a speech-language pathologist and practicum supervisor specializing in traumatic brain injury and stroke neurorehabilitation. I received my M.S. in Communication Disorders from SUNY New Paltz, where I researched reading in multilingualism and nonword repetition in young children. I received my B.A. in Speech and Hearing Science from the University at Buffalo, where I researched tDCS-induced changes to visuo-motor performance.

I like science and basketball (together or separate). When I am not working, I am spending time with my family, swimming, hiking, and [reading](https://oku.club/user/mjm).
