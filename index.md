I am a second-year Ph.D. student and NIH/NIDCD T32 and [NSF UtB](https://www.bu.edu/neurophotonics-nrt/) trainee in the Speech, Language & Hearing Sciences program at Sargent College, Boston University. Here, I work with the support and mentorship of Dr. [Swathi Kiran](https://www.bu.edu/sargent/profile/swathi-kiran-ph-d-ccc-slp/) in the [Aphasia Research Laboratory](https://www.bu.edu/aphasiaresearch/).

I am also a clinical speech-language pathologist (SLP) specializing in traumatic brain injury and stroke neurorehabilitation. Prior to my work in Boston, I was an SLP and clinical supervisor at the [Northeast Center for Rehabilitation and Brain Injury](http://www.northeastcenter.com), situated in the bucolic Hudson Valley, New York.  

When I am not working, I am spending time with my family, cycling, hiking, and reading. I like film, music, philosophy, science, and podcasts about these things.
