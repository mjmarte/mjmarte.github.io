I am a Ph.D. candidate in Speech, Language & Hearing Sciences at Boston University (BU). Here, I work with the support and mentorship of Dr. [Swathi Kiran](https://www.bu.edu/sargent/profile/swathi-kiran-ph-d-ccc-slp/) in the [Center for Brain Recovery](https://www.bu.edu/cbr/). My primary research interest is bi/multilingual aphasia. 

Prior to BU, I was a speech-language pathologist and practicum supervisor specializing in traumatic brain injury and stroke neurorehabilitation. I received my M.S. in Communication Disorders from (SUNY New Paltz)[[https://www.newpaltz.edu](https://www.newpaltz.edu/commdis/)] and my B.A. in Speech and Hearing Science from the (University at Buffalo)[https://arts-sciences.buffalo.edu/cds.html].

When I am not working, I am spending time with my family, swimming, shooting hoops, and [reading](https://oku.club/user/mjm).
