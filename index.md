I am a third-year Ph.D. student and [NSF UtB](https://www.bu.edu/neurophotonics-nrt/) trainee at Boston University. Here, I research (primarily) multilingual aphasia with the support and mentorship of Dr. [Swathi Kiran](https://www.bu.edu/sargent/profile/swathi-kiran-ph-d-ccc-slp/) in the [Aphasia Research Laboratory](https://www.bu.edu/aphasiaresearch/).

Prior to BU, I was a clinical speech-language pathologist and practicum supervisor specializing in traumatic brain injury and stroke neurorehabilitation. I received my M.S. in Communication Disorders from SUNY New Paltz, where I researched reading in multilingualism and nonword repetition in young children. I received my B.A. in Speech and Hearing Science from the University at Buffalo, where I researched tDCS-induced changes to visuo-motor performance.

When I am not working, I am spending time with my family, cycling, hiking, and reading. I like film, music, philosophy, science, politics, basketball, and podcasts about these things.
